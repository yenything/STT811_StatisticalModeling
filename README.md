# Android Malware Classification

**Project Overview**  
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying Android malware into different types, as well as distinguishing between malignant and benign malware. The project is divided into four Jupyter notebooks, each serving a specific purpose in the development process.

**Notebook Descriptions**  
NOTEBOOK1: Initial Data Analysis  
This notebook provides an exploratory data analysis of the entire dataset. It presents an overview of the data's structure, characteristics, and statistical properties, allowing us to gain a better understanding of the features and relationships between different malware types and benign samples.

NOTEBOOK2: Binary Classification  
This notebook focuses on binary classification between malignant and benign malware. It involves the development and evaluation of machine learning models to differentiate between malicious and benign applications, serving as a foundational step in the overall malware classification process.

NOTEBOOK3: Feature Engineering on Sample Data  
This notebook presents our initial work on a sample dataset to understand and confirm the effectiveness of various feature engineering techniques. It allows us to experiment with different approaches in a more focused and manageable context before applying them to the entire dataset.

NOTEBOOK4: Final Model Development and Evaluation  
This notebook contains the final work on feature engineering, resampling, encodings, and model development to obtain the best possible classifier for distinguishing between different types of malignant malware. It consolidates the insights and techniques derived from the previous notebooks to create a robust and accurate machine learning model for Android malware classification.

By following this structured approach across the four notebooks, we ensure a comprehensive and systematic development process, resulting in a high-performing model for Android malware detection and classification.
